# Project 2: React
## Valorant Weapon Skins

This Project will showcase the different weapons that are in the popular 
FPS, (first-person-shooter), game Valorant, and their respective skin selections

## Motivation

Games have always been been my outlet for entertainment and relaxation and
a one of the key aspects that I like about games are the aesthetics. In Valorant, 
one of the only ways to change the aesthetics is changing the weapon skin and so
instead of continuously launching the game and going into the inventory menu to
browse the different skins that are available, or have been available in the past, 
this app will allow a user to look at the skins outside of the game whenever they want.

## Framework Used

React

## How to Use

- Simply click on a weapon you would like to look at
- On the next page the weapon will show with its stats
- A list will also populate with different names for each skin
- Click on which skin you would like to look at and enjoy!
